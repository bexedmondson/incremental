plan:
parse json data
pass each building data objects down through the components, separating as we go
when the building view is initialised, set up so that in the state is:
    - building count
    - can afford flag
and subscribe to the cost resource(s) custom events with this:
    document.addEventListener('wood', function({ check can afford, change state if needed })

set up some kind of resource manager object at the top that takes in all the data
this can set up a function that runs the calculation every second
if a resource quantity changes, do this:
    const event = new Event('wood');
    document.dispatchEvent(event);

or maybe
    const customEvent = new CustomEvent('wiid', { detail: { currentCount: 10 } });
    document.dispatchEvent(customEvent);

the resource manager can also have a render method which can be another game section
